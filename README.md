## Abstract 
One native source of quality deterioration in medical imaging, and especially in our case optical coherence
tomography (OCT), is the turbid biological media in which photon does not take a predictable path and many scattering
events would influence the effective path length and change the polarization of polarized light. This inherent
problem would cause imaging errors even in the case of high resolution of interferometric methods. To address this
problem and considering the inherent random nature of this problem, in the last decades some methods including
Monte Carlo simulation for OCT was proposed. In this approach simulation would give us a one on one comparison
of underlying physical structure and its OCT imaging counterpart. Although its goal was to give the practitioners a
better understanding of underlying structure, it lacks in providing a comprehensive approach to increase the accuracy
and imaging quality of OCT imaging and would only provide a set of examples on how imaging method might falter.
To mitigate this problem and to demonstrate a new approach to improve the medical imaging without changing any
hardware, we introduce a new pipeline consisting of Monte Carlo simulation followed by a deep neural network.
